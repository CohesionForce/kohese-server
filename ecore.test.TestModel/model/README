 To turn on use of xmi:id and references via these ids (href):
 
 1. Open the genmodel with the EMF Generator.
 2. In the second level of the genmodel, change Model->Resource Type to 'XMI'
 3. Save and Regenerate.
 4. open src/TestModel.util/TestModelResourceImpl.java
 5. uncomment the useUUID method
 6. Save and regenerate. New instances created in the editor should now have xmi:id fields.
 
 To turn off xmi:id use:
 
 Use the above instructions but change Resource Type to 'none' and comment the useUUID method.
 
 Important: It appears xmi:id will continue to be used even after it is turned 
 off using the above. It seems all fields referencing uuid need to be manually 
 removed via the text editor. As a result, it would be recommended to only 
 save new files rather than modify old ones.
